# Current Task: Build multi-part vessel system with joint connections

## Task Overview

**Task 4 from implementation plan**: Build multi-part vessel system with joint connections

This task extends the PhysicsVessel class to handle multiple RigidBody3D parts connected by joints, implementing a complete multi-part vessel physics system with mass aggregation and structural integrity testing.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Extend PhysicsVessel for Multi-Part Support
- Extend PhysicsVessel.cs to handle multiple RigidBody3D parts connected by Joint3D
- Implement joint creation and management system between vessel parts
- Add support for joint hierarchies and complex vessel structures
- Ensure proper part lifecycle management with joint dependencies

### 2. Implement Joint System with Tuning Parameters
- Implement joint system using Generic6DOFJoint3D for flexible connections
- Create JointTuning struct for stiffness/damping parameters
- Add support for different joint types (fixed, hinge, ball) with proper configuration
- Implement joint parameter adjustment for performance and stability

### 3. Create Mass Aggregation System
- Create mass aggregation system to calculate total mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia tensor
- Implement efficient mass property updates when parts are added/removed
- Add proper handling of mass distribution changes during simulation
- Ensure mass calculations are accurate for orbital mechanics integration

### 4. Add Part Addition/Removal Handling
- Add part addition/removal handling with atomic mass property updates
- Implement safe joint connection and disconnection procedures
- Handle cascade effects when parts are removed (joint cleanup)
- Ensure no physics glitches during dynamic vessel modification

### 5. Structural Integrity Testing
- Test 10-part vessel structural integrity under 50kN thrust loading
- Validate joint stability under high loads and dynamic conditions  
- Measure performance impact of multi-part vessels vs single parts
- Test edge cases: long chains, complex branching structures

## Files to Create/Modify

- **Core Physics Enhancement**:
  - `src/Core/PhysicsVessel.cs` - Extend for multi-part vessel support with joints
  - `src/Core/JointTuning.cs` - Joint parameter configuration struct (new file)
  
- **Test Scenes**:
  - `scenes/multi_part_test.tscn` - Multi-part vessel testing scene
  - Update existing `scenes/physics_test.tscn` for multi-part validation
  
- **Additional Classes**:
  - May need additional helper classes for joint management

## Success Criteria

- [ ] PhysicsVessel handles multiple RigidBody3D parts with Joint3D connections
- [ ] Generic6DOFJoint3D system implemented with JointTuning parameters
- [ ] Mass aggregation calculates total mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia
- [ ] Part addition/removal works with atomic mass property updates
- [ ] 10-part vessel maintains structural integrity under 50kN thrust
- [ ] Performance remains within physics budget (≤5ms total)
- [ ] No physics glitches during dynamic vessel modification
- [ ] Integration with existing PhysicsManager and PerformanceMonitor

## Performance Targets

- Multi-part vessel physics: <3ms per frame for 10-part vessel
- Joint computation overhead: <0.5ms per joint per frame
- Mass calculation updates: <0.1ms per vessel modification
- Memory allocation: <2KB per vessel regardless of part count
- Structural stability: No joint failures under rated loads

## Requirements Fulfilled

- **Requirement 2.1**: Physics engine integration (multi-part vessels)
- **Requirement 2.2**: 60Hz fixed timestep with complex structures
- **Requirement 2.3**: Performance monitoring for multi-part systems
- **Requirement 2.4**: Advanced vessel physics management
- **Requirement 2.5**: Complex mass properties calculation
- **Requirement 2.6**: Multi-body collision detection
- **Requirement 2.7**: Deterministic multi-part physics

## Technical Notes

From tasks.md:
- Use Generic6DOFJoint3D for flexible joint connections between parts
- JointTuning struct should contain stiffness and damping parameters
- Mass aggregation must be efficient for real-time updates
- Atomic mass property updates prevent physics discontinuities
- Test with realistic rocket structures (linear stacks, radial attachments)
- Thrust loading test simulates main engine ignition scenarios

## Validation Commands

After implementation:
- "Test the multi-part vessel system with a 10-part rocket"
- "Apply 50kN thrust and verify structural integrity"
- "Measure performance with complex vessel structures"
- "Test part addition and removal during simulation"
- "Validate mass property calculations are accurate"
