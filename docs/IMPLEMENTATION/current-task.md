# Current Task: Create flight camera system with smooth following

## Task Overview

**Task 13 from implementation plan**: Create flight camera system with smooth following

This task implements a comprehensive flight camera system with smooth following behavior, zoom controls, rotation controls, and multiple camera modes. The system must maintain 60 FPS performance while providing smooth camera movement and proper integration with the floating origin system.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create FlightCamera GDScript System
- Create `src/Scripts/FlightCamera.gd` in GDScript with smooth follow using lerp for performance
- Implement relative offset storage to target vessel with proper Vector3 calculations
- Add floating origin handling to maintain camera position during coordinate shifts
- Implement zero allocations per frame rule with efficient vector calculations
- Port to C# if script time exceeds 3ms budget during testing

### 2. Implement Zoom Controls
- Add mouse wheel zoom controls with 5m-1000m range using exponential scaling
- Implement smooth zoom transitions with lerp interpolation over time
- Handle zoom speed based on current distance for intuitive control
- Clamp zoom range to prevent camera from getting too close or too far
- Optimize zoom calculations for consistent frame rate performance

### 3. Add Rotation Controls
- Implement right-click drag orbit controls around target vessel
- Maintain camera orientation during floating origin shifts
- Add pitch limits to prevent camera from flipping upside down
- Smooth rotation interpolation to prevent jerky movement
- Handle mouse sensitivity settings and input responsiveness

### 4. Create Camera Mode System
- **Chase Mode**: Camera follows behind rocket with fixed relative position
- **Free Mode**: Mouse control for unrestricted camera movement
- **Orbital Mode**: Top-down view for orbital mechanics visualization
- Mode switching with keyboard shortcuts (F1, F2, F3)
- Smooth transitions between camera modes with position interpolation

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Monitor script execution time to stay under 3ms budget
- Implement efficient vector calculations avoiding unnecessary allocations
- Cache frequently used calculations and transform data
- Use GDScript built-in functions for maximum performance
- Add performance monitoring and validation systems

### 6. Integration with Existing Systems
- Integrate with FloatingOriginManager for coordinate shift handling
- Connect to PhysicsVessel system for target tracking
- Coordinate with PerformanceMonitor for script time tracking
- Ensure compatibility with existing rendering and effects systems
- Handle vessel destruction and target switching gracefully

### 7. Testing and Validation
- Test all camera modes with smooth transitions and proper tracking
- Validate zoom controls work intuitively across full range
- Test floating origin shifts maintain camera stability
- Monitor performance with multiple vessels and complex scenes
- Verify camera system maintains 60 FPS under all conditions

## Files to Create/Modify

- **Camera System**:
  - Create `src/Scripts/FlightCamera.gd` - Main camera controller with smooth following and mode management (new file)
  - Create `scenes/flight_camera.tscn` - Flight camera scene with Camera3D node and input handling (new file)
  
- **Performance Integration**:
  - Update `src/Core/PerformanceMonitor.cs` - Add camera script time tracking and validation
  - Update existing scenes - Integrate flight camera system
  
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Create `scenes/camera_test.tscn` - Camera system testing scene with multiple vessels (new file)
  - Update existing test scenes - Add camera system validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] FlightCamera.gd with smooth follow using lerp and relative offset storage
- [ ] Mouse wheel zoom controls (5m-1000m range) with exponential scaling and smooth transitions
- [ ] Right-click drag orbit controls with pitch limits and floating origin handling
- [ ] Three camera modes: Chase (behind rocket), Free (mouse control), Orbital (top-down)
- [ ] Zero allocations per frame rule maintained, port to C# if script time >3ms
- [ ] Smooth transitions between all camera modes and proper target tracking
- [ ] Performance target: Camera script execution <3ms per frame at 60 FPS

## Performance Targets

- Camera script execution time: <3ms per frame (GDScript budget)
- Smooth follow interpolation: <1ms per frame
- Zoom and rotation controls: <0.5ms per frame
- Mode switching transitions: <2ms per operation
- Memory allocation: Zero allocations per frame
- Floating origin shift handling: <0.5ms per shift event

## Requirements Fulfilled

- **Requirement 6.1**: Smooth camera following with lerp interpolation
- **Requirement 6.2**: Zoom controls with intuitive mouse wheel interface
- **Requirement 6.3**: Rotation controls with right-click orbit behavior
- **Requirement 6.4**: Multiple camera modes for different flight phases
- **Requirement 6.5**: Performance optimization maintaining 60 FPS
- **Requirement 6.6**: Floating origin system integration
- **Requirement 6.7**: Zero allocation per frame rule compliance

## Technical Notes

From tasks.md and camera system principles:
- GDScript preferred for UI/camera code under 3ms budget for better performance
- Smooth follow using Vector3.lerp() with time-based interpolation
- Exponential zoom scaling: distance = min_zoom * pow(scale_factor, zoom_level)
- Orbit controls using spherical coordinates with pitch/yaw angles
- Mode switching with smooth Vector3.slerp() transitions between positions
- Floating origin integration through IOriginShiftAware implementation

### Camera System Architecture Overview
```gdscript
# Flight camera system
extends Camera3D
class_name FlightCamera

# Camera modes
enum CameraMode { CHASE, FREE, ORBITAL }

# Core functionality
func _ready(): # Initialize camera system
func _process(delta): # Update camera position and rotation
func _input(event): # Handle mouse and keyboard input
func set_target(vessel): # Set target vessel to follow
func set_mode(mode): # Switch camera modes with smooth transition
func handle_origin_shift(shift_vector): # Handle floating origin shifts
```

## Validation Commands

After implementation:
- "Test camera smooth following with vessel movement"
- "Validate zoom controls work across full 5m-1000m range"
- "Test rotation controls maintain orientation during vessel maneuvers"
- "Switch between all camera modes and verify smooth transitions"
- "Measure camera script performance and validate <3ms budget"
