# Current Task: Setup C#/GDScript Integration Foundation

## Task Overview

**Task 1 from implementation plan**: Setup C#/GDScript integration foundation and validate performance characteristics

This task builds on the API validation to create a working foundation for C# and GDScript integration with proper performance monitoring and boundaries.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create C# Test Node
- Create C# test node inheriting from Node3D with basic Update() method
- Implement basic lifecycle methods (_Ready, _Process, _PhysicsProcess)
- Test node registration and signal connectivity

### 2. Implement Double3 Integration
- Extend existing Double3 struct with additional orbital calculation utilities
- Add conversion utilities optimized for frequent Godot.Vector3 conversion
- Validate conversion performance meets <0.1ms per 1000 operations target

### 3. Build PerformanceMonitor Singleton
- Convert existing PerformanceMonitor to singleton pattern
- Add overlay display for real-time performance tracking
- Track frame time, physics time, script time with visual indicators
- Implement performance warning system when targets exceeded

### 4. Test Signal Marshaling Performance
- Create test scenarios for C# to GDScript signal communication at 60Hz
- Measure overhead of different signal payload types
- Document performance characteristics and establish boundaries
- Validate packed signal approach for UI communication

### 5. Validate Memory Management
- Implement object pooling patterns if needed for performance
- Test C# garbage collection impact on frame timing
- Measure memory allocation patterns during typical operations
- Document memory management best practices

### 6. Document UI Performance Boundaries
- Establish rule: C# aggregates state, emits one packed signal per frame to GDScript
- Create example implementation of this pattern
- Measure and validate performance improvement vs. high-frequency signals
- Document the performance boundary rules

## Files to Create/Modify

- `src/Core/CSharpTestNode.cs` - Basic C# Node3D implementation
- Extend `src/Core/Double3.cs` - Add orbital calculation utilities  
- Extend `src/Core/PerformanceMonitor.cs` - Convert to singleton, add overlay
- `src/Scripts/UIBridge.gd` - GDScript UI bridge example
- `test_scenes/integration_test.tscn` - Integration testing scene
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_BOUNDARIES.md` - Document C#/GDScript performance rules

## Success Criteria

- [ ] C# test node successfully inherits from Node3D and integrates with scene tree
- [ ] Double3 conversion utilities validated at <0.1ms per 1000 operations
- [ ] PerformanceMonitor singleton provides real-time overlay display
- [ ] Signal marshaling overhead measured and documented
- [ ] Memory management patterns validated with no frame time impact
- [ ] UI performance boundary documented with working example
- [ ] Integration test scene runs at stable 60 FPS

## Performance Targets

- Frame time: ≤16.6ms (60 FPS) consistently
- Physics time: ≤1ms for basic integration test
- Script time: ≤1ms for minimal C# operations
- Signal marshaling: <0.5ms overhead for packed signals
- Memory allocation: No GC pressure causing frame drops

## Requirements Fulfilled

- **Requirement 1.1**: C# physics system foundation
- **Requirement 1.2**: GDScript UI system integration  
- **Requirement 1.3**: Performance monitoring implementation
- **Requirement 1.4**: Memory management validation
- **Requirement 1.5**: Type conversion overhead verification
- **Requirement 1.6**: Signal marshaling performance
- **Requirement 1.7**: Cross-language communication boundaries

## Technical Notes

From tasks-og.md:
- C# handles performance-critical physics and orbital calculations
- GDScript manages UI and non-performance-critical gameplay logic
- Use singleton pattern for core systems (PhysicsManager, PerformanceMonitor)
- Implement object pooling for frequently allocated objects
- Signal frequency must be limited to maintain 60 FPS target

## Validation Commands

After implementation:
- "Run the integration test scene and show me the performance metrics"
- "Test the C# to GDScript signal communication"
- "Verify the Double3 conversion performance"
- "Show me the memory allocation patterns"
