- Add throttle response curves for different engine types
- Integrate throttle with fuel consumption and thrust calculations

### 5. Create Thrust Visualization System
- Implement thrust vector visualization with arrows scaled by thrust magnitude
- Color-code thrust vectors by engine efficiency (atmospheric vs vacuum performance)
- Add real-time thrust display showing current thrust, maximum thrust, and efficiency
- Create visual feedback for engine state changes and throttle adjustments
- Ensure visualization performance meets <0.5ms per engine rendering budget

### 6. Build Exhaust Effects System

- Scale exhaust effects based on thrust level, atmospheric density, and engine efficiency
- Implement exhaust light emission and heat distortion effects for atmospheric flight

### 7. Physics Integration and Performance
- Integrate thrust forces with existing PhysicsVessel system for realistic physics
- Apply thrust forces at engine mount points with proper force direction
- Handle engine failure scenarios and asymmetric thrust situations
