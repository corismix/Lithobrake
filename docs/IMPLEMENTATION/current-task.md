# Current Task: Implement anti-wobble system with dynamic joint stiffening

## Task Overview

**Task 5 from implementation plan**: Implement anti-wobble system with dynamic joint stiffening

This task builds on the multi-part vessel system to implement an intelligent anti-wobble system that dynamically adjusts joint stiffness based on atmospheric conditions and vessel configuration. The system prevents structural wobble in tall rocket stacks while maintaining realistic physics behavior.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create AntiWobbleSystem Class
- Create AntiWobbleSystem class with atmospheric pressure thresholds
- Implement Q_ENABLE=12kPa and Q_DISABLE=8kPa thresholds with hysteresis
- Add TAU=0.3s time constant for smooth exponential transitions
- Integrate with existing PhysicsVessel and JointTuning systems

### 2. Implement Wobble Detection System
- Create wobble detection based on dynamic pressure and chain length
- Calculate Q (dynamic pressure) from atmospheric density and velocity
- Implement hysteresis band to prevent oscillation between states
- Add vessel configuration analysis for wobble-prone structures

### 3. Build Progressive Stiffening System
- Implement smooth joint stiffness transitions using exponential smoothing
- Apply maximum 5x stiffness multiplier for severe conditions
- Use existing JointTuning.Scale() method for dynamic parameter adjustment
- Ensure progressive stiffening maintains physics stability

### 4. Add Virtual Struts for Long Chains
- Detect long chains (>5 parts) prone to wobble instability
- Create temporary virtual struts connecting parts to root vessel
- Implement automatic removal when atmospheric conditions improve
- Ensure virtual struts don't interfere with staging operations

### 5. Anti-Wobble System Testing
- Test 30-part rocket stack shows no wobble at maximum thrust
- Validate smooth transitions between stiffening states
- Measure performance impact of anti-wobble calculations
- Test edge cases: staging during wobble suppression, rapid acceleration changes

  - `src/Core/AtmosphericConditions.cs` - Atmospheric pressure and density calculations (new file)
  
- **Integration**:
  - `src/Core/PhysicsVessel.cs` - Integrate anti-wobble system with vessel physics
  - `src/Core/JointTuning.cs` - Add dynamic stiffening support if needed
  
- **Test Scenes**:
  - `scenes/anti_wobble_test.tscn` - 30-part rocket wobble testing scene
  - Update existing `scenes/multi_part_test.tscn` for anti-wobble validation

## Success Criteria

## Performance Targets

- Anti-wobble calculations: <0.5ms per frame for 30-part vessel
- Stiffness transitions: <0.2ms per vessel per frame
- Virtual strut management: <0.1ms per vessel per frame
- Memory allocation: <1KB additional per vessel

## Requirements Fulfilled

- **Requirement 2.1**: Physics engine integration (anti-wobble enhancement)
- **Requirement 2.2**: 60Hz fixed timestep with dynamic stiffening
- **Requirement 2.3**: Performance monitoring for anti-wobble system
- **Requirement 2.4**: Advanced vessel physics management
- **Requirement 2.5**: Complex joint parameter management
- **Requirement 2.6**: Multi-body stability systems
- **Requirement 2.7**: Deterministic anti-wobble behavior

## Technical Notes

From tasks.md:
- Q_ENABLE=12kPa threshold enables anti-wobble (high dynamic pressure)
- Q_DISABLE=8kPa threshold disables anti-wobble (hysteresis prevents oscillation)
- TAU=0.3s time constant for exponential smoothing of stiffness changes
- Virtual struts only for long chains (>5 parts) to prevent excessive complexity
- Progressive stiffening with maximum 5x multiplier maintains physics realism
- Anti-wobble system should integrate seamlessly with existing joint tuning

### Anti-Wobble Algorithm Overview
```csharp
// Simplified anti-wobble logic
Q = 0.5 * atmospheric_density * velocity_squared
wobble_factor = CalculateWobbleFactor(chain_length, Q);
target_stiffness = base_stiffness * Mathf.Clamp(wobble_factor, 1.0f, 5.0f);
current_stiffness = Mathf.Lerp(current_stiffness, target_stiffness, Time.fixedDeltaTime / TAU);
```
