# Completed Tasks

This document tracks completed implementation tasks with notes on any issues or deviations.

## Progress Log

### Documentation Reorganization - Complete
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Tasks Completed**:
- Created new documentation structure (docs/IMPLEMENTATION/, docs/REFERENCE/, docs/GUIDES/)
- Moved tasks.md to docs/IMPLEMENTATION/tasks.md
- Updated CLAUDE.md with navigation and workflow sections
- Created current-task.md with Task 0.5 ready for implementation
- Created this progress tracking document
- Created claude-code-guide.md for usage instructions

**Notes**: Documentation is now optimized for Claude Code usage with clear separation between execution, reference, and guidance documents.

### Task 0.5: Verify Godot 4.4.1 C# API Surface and Performance Characteristics
**Date**: December 14, 2024  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Details**: Successfully verified critical Godot 4.4.1 C# APIs and implemented comprehensive performance testing framework. Confirmed Engine.TimeScale and Engine.PhysicsTicksPerSecond APIs are available and functional.

**Files Created**:
- `src/Core/Double3.cs` - Double precision vector struct with conversion utilities
- `src/Core/PerformanceMonitor.cs` - Real-time performance tracking system  
- `src/Core/ApiValidation.cs` - Comprehensive API validation testing
- `test_scenes/api_validation.tscn` - Test scene for validation
- `performance_baseline.md` - Performance baseline documentation

**Performance Framework**: 
- Frame time monitoring (target ≤16.6ms)
- Physics time tracking (target ≤5.0ms) 
- Script time measurement (target ≤3.0ms)
- Double3 conversion benchmarking (target <0.1ms/1000ops)
- Real-time performance overlay with color-coded indicators

**API Validation Results**:
- ✅ Engine.TimeScale API confirmed available for time warp functionality
- ✅ Engine.PhysicsTicksPerSecond API confirmed for 60Hz physics configuration
- ✅ Vector3/Transform3D marshaling support verified
- ✅ Godot 4.4.1 C# integration working on macOS M4 hardware

**Notes**: All required APIs are available in Godot 4.4.1. Performance monitoring framework is ready for continuous validation during development. Hardware confirmed as MacBook Air M4 with Metal graphics support.

### Task 1: Setup C#/GDScript Integration Foundation
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Details**: Successfully implemented comprehensive C#/GDScript integration foundation with performance monitoring, memory management, and validated signal marshaling patterns. All performance targets met and documented with working examples.

**Files Created**:
- `src/Core/CSharpTestNode.cs` - C# Node3D test implementation with lifecycle methods and performance tracking
- `src/Core/MemoryManager.cs` - Object pooling and GC impact validation system
- `src/Scripts/UIBridge.gd` - GDScript UI bridge demonstrating signal marshaling patterns  
- `test_scenes/integration_test.tscn` - Comprehensive integration test scene
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_BOUNDARIES.md` - Complete performance boundary documentation with examples

**Files Modified**:
- `src/Core/Double3.cs` - Added orbital mechanics utilities and optimized conversion methods
- `src/Core/PerformanceMonitor.cs` - Converted to singleton pattern with enhanced monitoring and warning system

**Performance Results**:
- ✅ Double3 conversion performance: <0.1ms per 1000 operations target met
- ✅ Signal marshaling overhead: <0.5ms for packed signals validated
- ✅ Memory management: Object pooling implemented with GC impact monitoring
- ✅ Frame timing: 60 FPS stability maintained during integration tests
- ✅ C# node lifecycle: _Process <1ms, _PhysicsProcess <1ms measured

**Integration Features Implemented**:
- Singleton PerformanceMonitor with real-time overlay display
- Object pooling system for Double3 arrays, Vector3 arrays, and Dictionaries
- Packed signal pattern demonstrating C# → GDScript communication  
- Memory validation with GC collection tracking
- Performance warning system with configurable thresholds
- Comprehensive test suite validating all integration points

**Notes**: Complete C#/GDScript integration foundation established with performance validation. All success criteria met. System ready for next implementation phase.
